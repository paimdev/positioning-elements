        <p>The rocks inside Gale crater hint there may not have been a large lake there after all</p>
        <p>NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona</p>
        <p>A purported ancient lake on Mars may have been far smaller than researchers thought. NASA’s Curiosity rover
          has been exploring Gale crater for more than eight years, and while early observations suggested the entire
          crater may once have been filled with water, a new analysis implies that it just had a series of ponds
          instead.</p>
        <p>Previous analyses of data from Curiosity have relied heavily on a measure called the chemical index of
          alteration to determine how rocks were weathered over time. Joseph Michalski at the University of Hong Kong
          and his colleagues have suggested that because this measure was developed for use on Earth, it may not be
          valid in the extreme Martian climate.</p>
        <p>Instead, they analysed the concentrations of various compounds that are expected to change based on different
          types of weathering over time. They found that some of the layers of rock Curiosity examined did interact with
          water at some point in their past, but more are likely to have formed outside of the water.</p>

        <p>“Over hundreds of metres of strata, it seems that the only layers that are demonstrably lacustrine [formed in
          a lake] are the lower few metres,” says Michalski. “Of the rocks visited by the rover… the fraction that is
          demonstrably lacustrine is something like 1 per cent.”</p>
        <p>These rocks were mostly in the lowest few metres of sediments in the crater, suggesting the lake was not
          nearly as deep or extensive as we thought. “There was likely a small lake or more likely a series of small
          lakes in the floor of Gale crater, but these were shallow ponds,” says Michalski.</p>
        <p>The rocks that didn’t form in water appeared to be volcanic, so Michalski says that they may have formed out
          of ash from volcanic eruptions after the water in Gale crater had dried up. Observations by other Mars
          missions have hinted that these sediments were deposited by wind, not water, so this may solve that mismatch.
